## üßº Data Cleaning Process

- üßπ Dropped 6 fully empty columns
- üîÑ Replaced comma decimal separators and converted to float
-  Convert to datetime data types
-  Convert to category data types
- ‚ùì Filled missing **categorical** data 
- üßÆ Filled missing **numeric** data with column **medians**

---

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generated descriptive statistics for numeric fields
- Created correlation heatmap to assess variable relationships
- Plotted histograms of:
  - Product `List Price`
  - `StandardCost` vs `ListPrice` vs `DealerPrice`
  - `Weight` and `DaysToManufacture`???????????????????

---

## üí° Key Insights

- Significant gaps in weight data may affect shipping analytics
- Product pricing structures are consistent within subcategories

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Ensure weight data is consistently entered for logistics
- Consider reviewing duplicate SKU imports during data entry
- Investigate outliers in pricing for premium products

---
 
## üìÇ Folder Structure

- `data/`: Raw dataset
- `src/`: Data cleaning scripts
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook for exploration
- `presentation/`: PDF export of the final report
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- No unique product IDs ‚Äî duplicates were inferred
- Some missing values in key columns may skew analysis
- Currency for prices not specified ‚Äî assume consistent

---

## üìä Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
